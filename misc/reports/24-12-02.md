<h1>02.12.2024 - Live Simulator Report 9</h1>

<p>
    JSON loader fixed, started work on sim model. Rebuilt some commands, introduced some new ones. Fully rebuilt and finished AVL tree, including search, insertation, deletion and balancing. AVL tree also includes a few helper functions that check for element existance, and that allows to quickly edit element by its key. <strong>First working prototype of a simulation</strong> that combines all previously created material. Now simulation on start creates random agents with random mutations on random positions, and launches them based on values loaded from JSON preset.
