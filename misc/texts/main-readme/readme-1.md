Live Simulator Project

Expanded Intro:

The "Live Simulator" project is a straightforward yet powerful demonstration of the basic principles behind evolution and neural networks. By simulating a dynamic environment where virtual organisms adapt, learn, and evolve over time, this project offers a hands-on exploration of how these fundamental concepts interact. Through iterative learning processes and survival challenges, it showcases how neural networks can be shaped by evolutionary forces, mimicking the way natural selection drives real-life organisms to become better suited to their surroundings. The project serves as an educational tool to illustrate how complex behaviors and decision-making processes can emerge from simple rules and adaptive learning mechanisms.
 
Expanded P1 - What this Project Uses:

The "Live Simulator" leverages a machine learning method known as the genetic algorithm, which is inspired by the natural processes of selection, mutation, and survival of the fittest. This evolutionary algorithm enables virtual organisms to evolve and adapt over time, simulating real-world biological phenomena. The project integrates a diverse array of data structures and applies various computational science challenges, providing innovative solutions through iterative refinement and adaptation.

Additionally, the simulator is built with a strong emphasis on project organization, making it efficient and scalable. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) serves as the foundation of its structure, promoting modularity, reusability, and ease of maintenance. Through OOP principles, the project maintains clear relationships between different components, making it easier to handle complex interactions and simulate intricate evolutionary processes.
