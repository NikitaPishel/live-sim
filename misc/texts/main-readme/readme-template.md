Live Simulator Project


Intro:
This project is a simple example of how evolution and neural networks work.
 
P1 - what this project uses:
This simulator uses machine learning method called genetic algorithm , inspired by natural selection and evolutionary proccess. It uses a large variety of data structures, computing science problems & their solvings, and good project structurization. It uses OOP paradigm as its main structuring base.

P2 - purpose of the project
I made this project to learn and show my understanding of how computing science and programming works. The topics this project covers are:

• Optimisation, Time and Space complexity
• Data structures - queries, binary trees and oriented graphs with loops
• OOP and working with objects
• Machine learing - genetic algorithm
• AI - Neural networks, activation of linear functions
• Implementation of Computing Science methods
• HTTP requests and networks
• Working with HTTP request frameworks: python requests and JS axios
• Python syntaxis and structure
• JS vue framework
• Python flask framework
• Python unit tests

P3 - features of the project
There are a lot of features this project includes, that allow it to work fast and efficiently. Neural Network has non-typical structurised and combines both methods of RNN and FNN. It can have loops that are the parts of a larger system. Also the model is highly customizable and later can be rebuilt into another classification of a task.
