## Introduction  
The Live-sim project is a tool that can be used for training and creating Neural Networks. It gives a set of functions, which allow the user to create and 

*The Live-sim project is a demonstration of how evolution and neural networks work. It simulates natural selection process and neural network structure, which allow to create artificial intelegence *

## Installation Guide
**Before the installation it is recommended to read the description first.**

Downloading a model is really simple, and can be implemented if you follow the simple instructions described bellow:

1. Clone the repository
First of all you need to git clone the repository. Just open your bash and enter the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikitaPishel/live-sim.git
```

2. install and activate environment
After you have the project installed on your computer, you need to install the environment using command promt:
```bash
python -m venv env
```
Then you need to activate it depending from your command promt you launch one of the commands.
Power Shell:
```bash
env/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```
On other shells:
```bash
env/Scripts/activate.bat
```

3. install packages
You need to install all the python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

There's 2 different manuals about this project
- [Short start](./manual-short.md): short and user-friendly which gives a simple explanation. Good for people who are not as familiar with programming, or people who want to save time.
- [Full manual](./manual-long.md): full with description of the code structure, its capabilities and limits. Good for people who want to deeply and correctly understand the framework and its capabilities.

## Purpose 
The live-sim was developed as a platform for improving my understanding of computing science, working on implementation and demonstrating my competence as a programmer. There's a set of different themes that I worked on during development:

- **Artificial Intelligence:** Creating neural networks from scratch and training them  
- **Optimization:** Making code as space and time efficient as possible by different methods
- **Custom Data Structures:** Creating DIY queries, binary trees, and directed graphs with loops.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Designing and managing objects for effective code abstraction.
- **Network and server system:** Work with HTTP requests using Python's **flask** library and JavaScript's **axios**.  
- **Testing:** Testing code using unit tests.  

**Frameworks and Libraries:**
- **Flask:** For server development.
- **Vue.js:** For frontend (UI development).  
- **Axios:** For creating HTTP requests.  

It is not just a tool, it's a challenge to myself. The whole point of a project is to build an AI from scratch. I started it on a set of restrictions, to make it more complex and interesting:

- The whole model should be built from scratch, so no AI modules or frameworks used (e. g. pyTorch or Tensorflow)
- Only custom data structures (except for built-in to python skeleton, e. g. array or set)
- Model must be able to train
- There should be an environment example that should be user-friendly, so it can be used for learning or showcasing to people who are not very familiar with programming or/and how AI works.

## Features of the Project  
The project has a range of features designed for model's efficiency and adaptability:  

1. **Hybrid Neural Network Architecture:**  
   Combines characteristics of both **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**. The model supports looped structures within a larger system, offering dynamic adaptability for varied tasks.

2. **Customizability:**  
   The model is highly flexible. Its core can be trained and used in any imaginable task and will stay with no changes.

3. **Efficient Execution:**  
   For its structute it gives optimal results by using a list of different algorithms and structures
