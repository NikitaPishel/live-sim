## Instalation Guide
**Before the instalation it is recommended to read the description first.**

Project instalation is really simple, and can be implemented if you follow the simple instructions described bellow:

1. Clone the repository
First of all you need to git clone the repository. Just open your bash and enter the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikitaPishel/live-sim.git
```

2. install and activate environment
After you have the project installed on your computer, you need to install the environment using command promt:
```
python -m venv env
```
Then you need to activate it depending from your command promt you launch one of the commands.
Power Shell:
```
env/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```
Other:
```
env/Scripts/activate.bat
```

3. install packages
You need to install all the python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Introduction  
The Live-sim project is a demonstration of how evolution and neural networks work. It simulates natural selection processes of simple artificial models, which were inspired by biological mechanisms of real cells.  

## Learning Model
At its fundation, this simulator uses machine learning model calld **genetic algorithm**. As I said earlier, the project is inspired on biological methods of real cells, and in aplication of same method works this model. It creates random mutations inside the genetic algorithm to optimize the  It is designed with a robust foundation in computer science principles, featuring:  

- **Data structures and mechanisms:** Work on optimisation using different data structures and mechanisms
- **Project structuring:** Structurized basing on the **OOP** paradigm.

## Purpose 
The live-sim was developed as a platform for improving author's understanding of computing science and programming and demonstrating my knowledge. Also this project is referred to philosophical questioning of what artificial intelegence is, and what are the consequences of its development. It shows how thin the line between words 'neural network' and 'biological system' actually is.

- **Optimization and Complexity:** Addressing time and space efficiency challenges.
- **Advanced Data Structures:** Leveraging queries, binary trees, and directed graphs with loops.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Designing and managing objects effectively.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Implementing neural networks and simple learning models  
- **Network and server system:** Work with HTTP requests using Python's **requests** library and JavaScript's **axios**.  
- **Frameworks and Tools:**  
  - **Python Flask:** For backend development.  
  - **JavaScript Vue.js:** For frontend interactivity.  
  - **Unit Testing:** Ensuring code reliability with Python's testing libraries.  
- **Programming Proficiency:** Mastering Python syntax and structure alongside Vue.js for web-based interfaces.

## Features of the Project  
The project integrates a range of advanced features designed for efficiency and adaptability:  

1. **Hybrid Neural Network Architecture:**  
   Combines characteristics of both **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**. The model supports looped structures within a larger system, offering dynamic adaptability for varied tasks.  

2. **Customizability:**  
   The neural network is highly flexible, allowing for modifications to fit different classification tasks or learning objectives.  

3. **Efficient Execution:**  
   The projectâ€™s structure and algorithms prioritize speed and resource efficiency, ensuring practical usability even in complex scenarios.
