## Data view
### In-home view
Some small data tables inside of page for quck view.

#### Avrg survivability
Shows percentage of survivability growth for the past a few simulations

#### Recent survivability percentage
Shows percentage of survivability in the past simulation

#### Recent passed amount
Shows amount of passed agents in the most recent simulation

### Graphical/table view
#### Genome
Shows genome of passed agents in a chosen iteration

### Graphs
#### survivability graph
Graph that shows how many percent of agents from total have passed

#### passed amount graph
Graph that shows how many agents have passed

## Data post
### Sign up
JSON web token based login. Allows to shutdown and view info only to people with provided access.

### Shutdown simulation
